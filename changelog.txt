	* Updated AGX intergration to use new external methods for getting group names.
	* Fixed an issue that could cause AGOS' input locks to persist through scene changes
	* Vastly improved AGOS' vessel switching logic. Action group configs should now display correctly when switching vessels.
	* Improved how AGOS handles action group duplication on flight reverts. There should be *no* circumstances in which this happens now.

06/05/2015, v2.0.7:
	* Art pass on toolbar button
	* Fixed a couple of things that relied on statements that would never fire.

02/05/15, v2.0.6:
	* Fixed an issue that could cause action group configs to be overridden by a previous flight's if the player transitioned to the FLIGHT scene without going through the editor first.
	* Non-Custom (SAS, RCS, Lights, etc.) action groups are now correctly listed with AGX installed.
		* Due to this change, some group IDs were changed. If you run with AGX, double check your group configs.
	* Fixed an issue where action group configs could duplicate if the player reverted to launch and then reverted to the editor.
	* Fixed action groups being fired multiple times when staging.
	* All selected action groups and part links are now cleared when the GUI is closed in the editor if they're not commited.

	* Completely re-written code base!
	* New "all-in-one" GUI - no more managing multiple GUIs while configuring groups!
	* AGOS can now change the camera modes
	* AGOS can toggle Fine Controls
	* And most importantly: 1.0 compatibility!

06/02/15, v1.2.5:
	* Fixed AGOS modules not applying to stock launch clamps if Extraplanetary Launchpads is installed. [Reported by ShimmyTheJJ]

16/12/14, v1.2.4:
	* 0.90 Compatibility
	* Action groups available are now limited depending on VAB tier (careeer only).
		* Locked action groups will be displayed in red if they are already in a vessel's configuration and will not fire upon staging.
	* Throttle level can now be changed on stage.
	* Reduced the amount of data AGOS needs to save to save files
	* "Stage" is now a valid action group (but requires save editing to use and probably doesn't work how you'd hope anyway).
	* Tweaked the GUI, no longer has a "H" button as parts are highlighted when the config GUI opens and "R" button changed to say "Remove".
	* [iPeerLib] Skins are now correctly set based on order of preference.

15/10/14, v1.2.3:
	* Fixed an issue with GUI skinning on modded 0.25 installs.

	* Part highlighting is now disabled when all dialogues for that part are closed.

05/10/14, v1.2:
	* Users can now have duplicate actions groups which fire based on separate criteria:
		* "Active Vessel Only": Fires the configured action group(s) to fire only on the vessel that the player has control of after staging.
		* "Connected Stage Only": Fires the configued action group(s) on the stage which the decoupler stays connected to (this requires a probe on that stage).
		* "All Stages": Both of the above configurations combined.
	* AGroupOnStage now only saves information it needs to the save file, cutting down on their size for large vessels.
	* The module's name is now correctly defined in-game.
	* Fixed click-through on the GUIs in the editors.
	* Using a separate library for "reusable" parts of code instead of having multiple copies of it everywhere.
