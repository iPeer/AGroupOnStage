	* Fixed an issue with part locked configurations when reverting to the editor.

30/04/15, v2.0.2:
	* Added compatibility for Action Groups Extended.
	* Fixed an issue causing part references to be lost when reloading a vessel.

30/04/15, v2.0.1:
	* Fixes an issue with AGOS saving group configs on ships created before AGOS' installation.

27/04/15, v2.0:
	* Completely re-written code base!
	* New "all-in-one" GUI - no more managing multiple GUIs while configuring groups!
	* AGOS can now change the camera modes
	* AGOS can toggle Fine Controls
	* And most importantly: 1.0 compatibility!

06/02/15, v1.2.5:
	* Fixed AGOS modules not applying to stock launch clamps if Extraplanetary Launchpads is installed. [Reported by ShimmyTheJJ]

16/12/14, v1.2.4:
	* 0.90 Compatibility
	* Action groups available are now limited depending on VAB tier (careeer only).
		* Locked action groups will be displayed in red if they are already in a vessel's configuration and will not fire upon staging.
	* Throttle level can now be changed on stage.
	* Reduced the amount of data AGOS needs to save to save files
	* "Stage" is now a valid action group (but requires save editing to use and probably doesn't work how you'd hope anyway).
	* Tweaked the GUI, no longer has a "H" button as parts are highlighted when the config GUI opens and "R" button changed to say "Remove".
	* [iPeerLib] Skins are now correctly set based on order of preference.

15/10/14, v1.2.3:
	* Fixed an issue with GUI skinning on modded 0.25 installs.

07/10/14, v1.2.2:
	* Recompiled against 0.25 libraries
    
ï»¿05/10/14, v1.2.1:
	* The main GUI for action groups is now hidden while you are selecting new groups to be fired.
	* Fixed an issue with control lock triggers not matching dialogue positions.
	* Part highlighting is now disabled when all dialogues for that part are closed.

05/10/14, v1.2:
	* Users can now have duplicate actions groups which fire based on separate criteria:
		* "Active Vessel Only": Fires the configured action group(s) to fire only on the vessel that the player has control of after staging.
		* "Connected Stage Only": Fires the configued action group(s) on the stage which the decoupler stays connected to (this requires a probe on that stage).
		* "All Stages": Both of the above configurations combined.
	* AGroupOnStage now only saves information it needs to the save file, cutting down on their size for large vessels.
	* The module's name is now correctly defined in-game.
	* Fixed click-through on the GUIs in the editors.
	* Using a separate library for "reusable" parts of code instead of having multiple copies of it everywhere.
	
15/09/14, v1.1.1:
	* Fixed an issue causing the GUI to become squashed on heavily modded installs.
	* Fix action groups not always being fired when a decouple has been decoupled.

10/09/14, v1.1:
	* Now uses a GUI to (de)select which action groups are fired.
		* Should be compatible with existing vessels, though I'd give them a quick check to be sure.
	* Removed some un-needed code
	* Made some code a little bit more efficient.

08/09/14, v1.0: Initial release
